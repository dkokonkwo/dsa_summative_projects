Assessment goals:

Implement Huffman coding to compress/decompress text file
Tasks:

Upload an existing file on the disc (your computer storage).
Build the Huffman tree based on the frequency of characters.
Compress the file using Huffman coding and store the compressed file in another file
Implement a decompression function to reconstruct the original file from the compressed data.
Identify the size of the original file vs the size of the compressed file.
